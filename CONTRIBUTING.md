# CONTRIBUTING

For general contributing guidelines and processes shared across all Cadence repositories, please see the [Cadence Contributing Guide](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This document contains specific instructions for contributing to the Cadence Helm Charts repository.

## Build and generate template yml locally

```bash
helm package ./charts/cadence
# Replace with current chart version
helm template cadence-release cadence-1.0.0.tgz > template_out.yaml
```

## Build and deploy to a k8s cluster

### 1. Update dependencies (if needed)
```bash
cd charts/cadence
helm dependency update
cd ../..
```

### 2. Build helm package and deploy to a k8s cluster
```bash
helm package ./charts/cadence
# Replace with current chart version
helm upgrade --install cadence-release cadence-1.0.0.tgz \
    -n cadencetest \
    --create-namespace
```

### 3. Port forward to check the UI
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/cadence-release-web 8088:8088 -n cadencetest
```

Visit http://localhost:8088 and validate it is accessible.

### 4. Port forward frontend service to run CLI commands
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/cadence-release-frontend 7833:7833 -n cadencetest
```

### 5. (Optional) Register a domain:
```bash
cadence \
    --address localhost:7833 \
    --transport grpc \
    --domain default \
    domain register \
    --retention 1
```

### 6. Run samples:
- Clone https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-samples

- Run sample worker (execute at samples repo root):
```bash
./bin/helloworld -m worker
```

- Trigger a workflow (execute at samples repo root):
```bash
./bin/helloworld -m trigger
```

### 7. Validate deployment
Visit http://localhost:8088 and validate the new workflow exists!

## Generate helm documentation

Install [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs):
```bash
go install github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs/cmd/helm-docs@latest
```

Generate documentation:
```bash
helm-docs
```

The `charts/cadence/README.md` file should be updated automatically.

## Release Process

### Before making a release:

1. **Update appVersion and dependencies**: 
   - Check if Cadence has a new release and update `appVersion` in `Chart.yaml`
   - Verify dependencies are using latest-1 stable versions:
     - Cassandra: Currently using `11.x.x` from Bitnami 
     - PostgreSQL: Currently using `16.x.x` from Bitnami  
     - MySQL: Currently using `12.x.x` from Bitnami
   - Update `global.image.tag` in `values.yaml` to match `appVersion`

2. **Update dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd charts/cadence
   helm dependency update
   cd ../..
   ```

3. **Test the changes**:
   - Build and deploy locally following the steps above
   - Validate all functionality works as expected

4. **Increment chart version**: Update the `version` field in `charts/cadence/Chart.yaml`:
   - Patch version (0.2.1): Bug fixes, dependency updates
   - Minor version (0.3.0): New features, breaking changes
   - Major version (1.0.0): Major breaking changes

5. **Update documentation**: Run `helm-docs` to regenerate the README.md

### Publishing:

After making changes to templates and incrementing the chart version in `charts/cadence/Chart.yaml`, merge your changes to the main branch. 

The automation will handle publishing the new version using [Chart Releaser Action](https://helm.sh/docs/howto/chart_releaser_action/). The Cadence chart is hosted on GitHub Pages.

After the new version is available in the helm repository, deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster to validate the release.

## Sign off Your Work

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. Here is the full text of the [DCO](http://developercertificate.org/). Contributors must sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to commit messages.

```text
This is my commit message

Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

See `git help commit`:

```text
-s, --signoff
    Add Signed-off-by line by the committer at the end of the commit log
    message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically
    certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same
    license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin (see
    http://developercertificate.org/ for more information).
```

## Version Management Checklist

When updating versions, ensure consistency across:
- [ ] `Chart.yaml`: Chart `version` bumped
- [ ] `values.yaml`: `global.image.tag` (should match with `Chart.yaml` appVersion)
- [ ] Dependencies in `Chart.yaml` (check for updates with `helm dependency update`, aim for latest major-1 stable)
- [ ] [DCO](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-off-your-work) signed
- [ ] Test deployment locally
- [ ] Run `helm-docs` to update documentation
